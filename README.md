# HTML and CSS manual

#### My HTML&CSS tutorial project.

It is in the form of a book and designed as a website.

Material is taken from John Duckett's book "HTML and CSS: Design and Build Websites" and from [htmlandcssbook.com](https://htmlandcssbook.com/) and [developer.mozilla.org](https://developer.mozilla.org/).

<strong>Site is made with <a href="https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/">Material for MkDocs</a>.</strong>
